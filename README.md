### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an infrastructure engineer and software engineer based in the U.S. with over a decade of experience solving complex technical problems in the technology and education sectors.

My passion is automation and removing toil from day-to-day operations. I enjoy learning new things and collaborating on projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building infrastructure automation using Python, BASH, Ansible, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes in AWS and on-prem.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes in AWS by studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on infrastructure automation or opensource projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding my next career opportunity, if you think you/we have a match, message me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/m3dev1).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I completed a Bachelors degree in 11 months.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a connection request or inmail on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/m3dev1).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been working remotely for over 15 years, I've consistently been a top performer, and absolutely love the flexibility and freedom that remote work provides.
